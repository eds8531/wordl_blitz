Ok, this is just a quick python program designed to show the percent of the time you'll win if you use certain starting words and 
then a simple greedy algorithm that just picks random words from a list of words that do not violate any information we gathered from earlier 
rows. For example if your first guess is 'slate' your second guess is 'round' and from the slate guess you know that the third letter must be 
an 'a' all remaining choices will have an 'a' as the third letter.
